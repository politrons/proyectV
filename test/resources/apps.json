You’ll join one of three teams and battle for the prestige and ownership of Gyms with your Pokémon at your side.\n\nPokémon are out there, and you need to find them. As you walk around a neighborhood, your smartphone will vibrate when there’s a Pokémon nearby. Take aim and throw a Poké Ball… You’ll have to stay alert, or it might get away!\n\nSearch far and wide for Pokémon and items\nCertain Pokémon appear near their native environment—look for Water-type Pokémon by lakes and oceans. Visit PokéStops, found at interesting places like museums, art installations, historical markers, and monuments, to stock up on Poké Balls and helpful items. \n\nCatching, hatching, evolving, and more\nAs you level up, you’ll be able to catch more-powerful Pokémon to complete your Pokédex. You can add to your collection by hatching Pokémon Eggs based on the distances you walk. Help your Pokémon evolve by catching many of the same kind. \n\nTake on Gym battles and defend your Gym\nAs your Charmander evolves to Charmeleon and then Charizard, you can battle together to defeat a Gym and assign your Pokémon to defend it against all comers.\n\nIt’s time to get moving—your real-life adventures await!\n\nNote: \n\n- This app is free-to-play and offers in-game purchases.

      "description": "Six! is the latest title from Gram Games, makers of the global smash hits, 1010! and Merged!. This newest game is challenging, exciting, and even infuriating, at times. Like all great puzzles, Six! will keep you entertained for just a moment, or will keep you engaged for hours of fun.\n\nThe game concept is simple: there is a tower of blocks of various shapes, upon which sits another hexagonal block. The aim of the game is to move the hexagon down the screen to earn points. To do this, you tap the different blocks, which will make them disappear. The hexagon can then fall into the empty space left behind.\n\nSounds simple enough, right? Wrong. As the blocks are destroyed, the hexagon will start to wobble and roll, and the tower will begin to tilt. It is your job to keep the tower balanced, and the hexagon from gaining momentum and rolling of. To do so, remove blocks strategically, and ensure that their removal won’t throw everything off balance. If the hexagon tips into the abyss, it’s game over, and you’ll have to start over again.\n\nChallenging, exciting, and surprisingly simple to play, Six! will have you hooked immediately. Like Gram’s other hits, the gameplay is simple and fun, but earning a spot on the leaderboard and competing with friends provides both a challenge, and a reward.\n\nKey Features\n●    Easy to learn, and fun to master gameplay\n●    Challenge your friend’s high scores, challenge the world\n●    Fun, colorful and engaging graphics\n●    Exciting and addictive\n●    Fun four hours, or just a few minutes",

      "description": "When the thermometer rises, bring it back down with a refreshing, chilling, ICEE!  Think you’re craving this legendary drink now?  Just wait until you build the ultimate, irresistible combination of flavors in ICEE MAKER!  Your taste buds will take you to the nearest ICEE machine! \n  \nLet the fun begin by choosing your cup and lid or create your very own cup design!  Next, choose from 20 different ICEE flavors, or create and name your very own flavor.  Show off your skills and become an official ICEE mixologist!  \n\nWhen it’s time to clean the machine, don’t worry, it’s much more fun than real life cleaning!  Once you’ve made that machine sparkle like new, personalize your cool creation with ICEE bear decals and other fun ICEE stickers.  And who could forget the straw?  Dig in and choose one of many swirly, curly, twirly straws.  You can even add colored stripes and logos to your straw!  \n  \nNow that your drink is just the way you like it, slurp it down and enjoy it to the last drop, share it on Facebook, email it to a friend, or save it in the freezer to enjoy later!  Maybe you’re up for an ICEE challenge?  See how many ICEEs you can drink in 30 seconds, but be sure to pace yourself… if you drink too fast, you will get a brain freeze!   After all, ICEEs were made to be perfect, not painful!   You won’t need snow cones, popsicles, ice pops or frozen yogurt when you can enjoy the absolute coolest treat around with ICEE MAKER!\n\nThanks for making us the #1 APP on the ENTIRE app store!  We appreciate all of our loyal fans and customers! \n\nAbout Us \nICEE Maker is brought to you by Sunstorm Games, the inventors of the Sunnyville series and the MAKER series of games, Fair Food Maker, Dessert Maker, and Candy Maker to name just a few.\nICEE Maker is free to play but in-app purchases are available in the game. \n\nProtecting privacy is especially important to us at Sunstorm Games.

Gain bonuses from daring tricks and collect coins to upgrade your car and reach even higher distances. Watch out though - Bill's stout neck is not what it used to be when he was a kid!

      "description": "Create yummy,sweet cupcakes in the original Cupcake Maker game!  Bake your way to delicious creations in the very best cupcake maker game out there!  \n  \nChoose your cake mix from a variety of flavors.  Next, add the eggs, oil, and water and stir until a smooth batter is formed.  Now it’s time to choose which liners you want.  How about bold colored foil, decorative, or traditional?  Maybe one of each!  After you have carefully selected 6, it’s time to spoon the batter in each liner, one by one.  \n  \nNow it’s time to bake those yummy cupcakes!  Place the pan in the oven and watch the batter turn into warm, moist, perfect cupcakes.  When the red indicator light turns off, your cupcakes are fully baked and ready for your decorating skills!  \n  \nNext, select the color and style of icing for each cupcake.  Maybe you want it piled high in purple or just spread evenly in white.  Then, top those cupcakes off with fun, colorful, and delicious items from 5 sweet categories: candies and nuts, candles, toppers, holidays and occasions, and extras.\n  \nWith all the choices, you will find yourself baking batch after batch of cupcakes in every flavor and color!  \n\nShare your cupcake creations!  Store them in the fridge for later.  Beware!  The more cupcakes you bake, the more you will crave the real thing! \n\nFor more fun, try your hand at Chop Shop or take the food challenge and see how many cupcakes you can eat in 30 seconds!\n\nAbout Us \nCupcake Maker is brought to you by Sunstorm Games, the inventors of the Sunnyville series and the MAKER series of games, Fair Food Maker, Dessert Maker, ICEE Maker and Candy Maker to name just a few. \n\nCupcake Maker is free to play but in-app purchases are available in the game. \n\nProtecting privacy is especially important to us at Sunstorm Games.
